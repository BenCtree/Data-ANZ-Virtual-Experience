# Data-ANZ-Virtual-Experience

This was a virtual experience offered by ANZ through InsideSherpa as part of their Data@ANZ program, which provides some insights into the sort of work the data science team at ANZ do. I completed both modules:

- Exploratory Data Analysis: I provided some preliminary descriptive statistics and segmented the data set by date and account, visualising transaction volume and spending and assessing the effect of outliers.

- Predictive Analytics: I estimated yearly salary of each account holder and explored correlations between salary and various customer attributes. Then I fit two predictive models - a multiple regression model and a decision-tree model and compared their in and out of sample predictive accuracy.

I coded both these modules in R and produced a small set of slides for the first module, explaining the findings of the preliminary exploration as well as a report for the whole project with code, discussion and visualisations integrated.
